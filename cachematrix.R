## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## This file consist of a pair of functions that help cache the inverse
## of a matrix.

## makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its
## inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inverse <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inverse <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inv) inverse <<- inv
    getinverse <- function() inverse
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
    
}


## cacheSolve function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the
## matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from
## the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    inv <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(inv)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inv)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    inv <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(inv)
    inv
}
